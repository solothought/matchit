This repo is friendly for first timers and other contributors. I would like to appreciate your effort and contribution. 

This application is made with the help of HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Jquery, and Riot js targetting non-technical users. So you're free to contribute in many possible ways. Like

* Create a card game and share the printables with us.
* Create a template and share with us so that other can use it to design cards games.
* Suggest new features and implement them too.

Don't hesitate to clear your doubts. If you're changes are small and generating `tags.js` is a bit complicated, it's ok to leave it. I'll do that. But ensure that you're changes are either in `*.tag` files only or in other files only

If you like this application, don't forget to share with your friends and [star](https://github.com/solothought/matchit/stargazers) it.
